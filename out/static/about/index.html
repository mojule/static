        <h1>The Crozier Story</h1>
        <p><img src="img/roast-turkey.jpg" alt="Roast turkey" /></p>
        <h2>How it started</h2>
        <p>
          In 1959, a 12 year old farm boy was looking for a way to make some
          pocket money. When a neighbour mentioned that there might be
          &quot;some money in turkeys&quot;, young Philip Crozier took his
          savings of £5.00 and bought himself a pair of hen turkeys and a
          &quot;gobbler&quot; (male turkey) with the intention of breeding
          them. There was a lot to learn and a lot of mistakes to be made but
          this was the beginning of Philip's lifetime obsession with breeding
          turkeys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Philip &quot;the turkey man&quot; and his wife Judith run
          their own 80-acre (33 hectares) turkey farm as a small yet thriving
          family business. &quot;Turkeyville&quot; is home of upwards to 20,000
          white-feathered turkeys. Over the years their four children have been
          and continue to be part of the team. Crozier's Free-Range Turkey Farm
          is situated at Dromore, a stone's throw from Ashburton on the clean,
          green sunny plains of Mid-Canterbury in New Zealand.

        <h2>Traditional methods</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to raising turkeys, the Croziers are happy to stick to
          traditional methods. Free to range and grub for foods outside, the
          turkeys are also supplied with a mixture of natural grains, some of
          which are grown on the farm. The Croziers practice crop rotation
          which involves growing their crops in different locations from one
          season to the next and moving the turkeys to suit. This keeps the
          soil, crops and turkeys in prime condition. The Southern New Zealand
          winter frosts are welcomed as a natural way of killing off any pests
          or diseases that might be tempted to take up residence on the farm.
          And because theirs is a small operation, the Croziers are able to
          keep a close check on the health and well-being of their turkeys.
