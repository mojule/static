    Preheat the oven to 160Â°C. Place bird in roasting dish and add 2 cups of
    water or stock to pan and cover with tin foil to trap in the juices.

    We recommend a cooking time of 35 minutes per kilo.

    Best way to check if your turkey is cooked is to cut into the thigh meat
    between the breast and the leg. The juices should run clear. Remove the
    turkey from the oven, lift out of tin, cover with foil and leave to rest for
    20 minutes.
