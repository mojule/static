    <li><span>Salt and pepper</span></li>
    <li><span>1 handful chopped walnuts</span></li>
    <li><span>1 zest of one orange</span></li>
    <li><span>300 g pork sausage meat</span></li>
    <li><span>1 large egg</span></li>
    <li><span>2 big handfuls breadcrumbs or almond meal for GF</span></li>
    <li><span>1 Crozier’s Free Range Turkey, about 4kg</span></li>

    <li><span>300 ml chicken stock</span></li>
    <li><span>1 teaspoon cornflour</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To make the stuffing, melt the unsalted butter in a saucepan and add the
    bacon, celery and rosemary. Cook gently with the lid on for about 10
    minutes, until the vegetables are very soft, but not coloured.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add the cranberries and half the cider and turn up the heat a little. When
    the liquid has reduced to a third of its volume, set it aside to cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mix in the nutmeg, allspice, some salt and pepper, the walnuts, orange zest,
    sausage meat and egg, then fold in the breadcrumbs or almond meal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Preheat the oven to 160°C . Pat the turkey’s skin dry with kitchen paper,
    then stuff the neck end with a little stuffing and the stuff the rest inside
    the bird. Rub the bird with the softened butter. Place in a roasting tin,
    add 2 cups of water to the pan, cover with foil and pop in the preheated
    oven.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend a cooking time of 35 minutes per kilo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remove the foil 30 minutes before the end of cooking time to brown up the
    skin.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best way to check if your turkey is cooked is to cut into the thigh
    meat, between the breast and the leg. The juices should run clear. Remove
    the turkey from the oven, lift out of the tin, cover with foil, then leave
    to rest for 20 minutes
  </p>
  <p>
    Skim off the fat, if any and set aside. Add the rest of the cider to the
    meat juices in the pan, along with the meat off the turkey wings and enough
    stock to cover the bottom of the pan. Stir in the cornflour, dissolved in a
    little water, and simmer on the stove until thickened. Sieve into a jug and
    serve with your turkey, stuffing and sides. Yum!
