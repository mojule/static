  We complement their natural diet of worms, grass, grass seeds and bugs with a
  natural feed we make in our very own mill on site at our farm. All the grains
  are sourced from local farms and vitamins are supplied by an animal nutrition
  specialist who also elaborates the diets for the birds. We have replaced
  antibiotics, commonly used in poultry for gut health, with probiotics and
  blended essential oils.
