# Life at Turkeyville

![Turkey hatchlings](/img/hatchlings.png)

## Incubating

From the beginning of October Judith is busy gathering eggs from the
breeding hens and putting them into an incubator where they are
monitored for 28 days.

## Hatching

From the beginning of November right through to the end of February, the
Croziers are transferring their month-old eggs to the hatchery.

## Rearing

When the poults (baby turkeys) are 5 Â½ weeks old they spend a brief time
in the rearing sheds before being released onto the farm.

## Getting ready for market

During New Zealand's summer months, mature turkeys, from 12 weeks of age
are gathered in for processing.

After killing, any waste products including the feathers all go into
composting for the farm. The necks and giblets are retained and sold
packaged inside the turkeys to be used for [stock, gravy and stuffing
ingredients.](#cooking--recipes)

The plucked and eviscerated birds are immediately dipped into [ozonated
water to chill and sterilise them.](#about--quality-assurance)

The turkeys are drained and then prepared for market. Some smaller cuts
and [products](#products--list) are prepared for the local market while
the bulk of the turkeys are prepared for [nationwide
distribution](#about--where-to-buy). Whole birds are prepared with their
legs tucked in close to the body which keeps the drumsticks moister
during cooking. Pop-Up timers are carefully inserted to make cooking
easier.
