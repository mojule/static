# The Crozier Story

## How it started

In 1959, a 12 year old farm boy was looking for a way to make some pocket money.
When a neighbour mentioned that there might be "some money in turkeys", young
Philip Crozier took his savings of Â£5.00 and bought himself a pair of hen
turkeys and a "gobbler" (male turkey) with the intention of breeding them. There
was a lot to learn and a lot of mistakes to be made but this was the beginning
of Philip's lifetime obsession with breeding turkeys.

Today, Philip "the turkey man" and his wife Judith run their own 80-acre (33
hectares) turkey farm as a small yet thriving family business. "Turkeyville" is
home of upwards to 20,000 white-feathered turkeys. Over the years their four
children have been and continue to be part of the team. Crozier's Free-Range
Turkey Farm is situated at Dromore, a stone's throw from Ashburton on the clean,
green sunny plains of Mid-Canterbury in New Zealand.

## Traditional methods

When it comes to raising turkeys, the Croziers are happy to stick to traditional
methods. Free to range and grub for foods outside, the turkeys are also supplied
with a mixture of natural grains, some of which are grown on the farm. The
Croziers practice crop rotation which involves growing their crops in different
locations from one season to the next and moving the turkeys to suit. This keeps
the soil, crops and turkeys in prime condition. The Southern New Zealand winter
frosts are welcomed as a natural way of killing off any pests or diseases that
might be tempted to take up residence on the farm. And because theirs is a small
operation, the Croziers are able to keep a close check on the health and
well-being of their turkeys.
